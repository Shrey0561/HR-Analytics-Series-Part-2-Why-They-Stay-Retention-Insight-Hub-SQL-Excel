# The Loyalty Blueprint: Who Stayed and Why?
This is Part 2 of my HR Analytics Series. While Part 1 focused on understanding employee attrition, this project shifts the lens toward retention, analyzing why employees choose to stay. Leveraging SQL for data wrangling and Excel for visualization, this project explores how factors like salary hikes, manager tenure, job involvement, and stock options influence long-term loyalty.

## Quick Project Snapshot
|Metric                      | Value      |
|----------------------------|------------|
|Total Employees             | 1470       |
|Overall Retention Rate      | 83.88%     |
|Average Tenure with Manager | 4.12 years |
|Average Salary Hike         | 15.21%     |

## Key Insights

### Salary Hike vs Retention
Retention peaked at *17-19% hikes*, but surprisingly dipped when hikes exceeded *23%*, suggesting potential misalignment between reward and satisfaction at higher brackets.

### Income Band & Loyalty
High-income employees showed the strongest loyalty (*89.2%*), while those in the low-income band had significantly lower retention (*71.39%*), pointing to compensation-driven churn risk.

### Manager Tenure
Employees with a manager who had *6+ years of experience* had the best retention outcomes (*89.95*), emphasizing the role of experienced leadership in fostering loyalty.

### Stock Option Level
Stock Option Level *2* emerged as the sweet spot for engagement and retention (*92.41%*), suggesting moderate incentives work better than none or too many.

### Job Involvement
Employees with *high job involvement (Level 4)* had the *lowest attrition* and *strongest loyalty* (90.97%). Engaged minds stay longer.

## Tools Used
 - *SQL*: Data cleaning, retention calculations
 - *Excel*: Dashboard creation, KPIs

## Why This Project Matters
While most HR dashboards focus on churn, this one celebrates *loyalty*. Understanding why people stay is just as critical as knowing why they leave. This project helps organizations double down on what's working and scale it.
